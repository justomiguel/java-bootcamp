# Java BootCamp base folders layout

Please, use this repository as a base for you training phase. The idea is to
fork this project so everyone use the same folder structure for the
exercises.

It's extremelly important to keep the key points easy to be verified by
the reviewers, so **don't mix the key points with the rest of the
exercises**

→ [index](#index)

###Duration

Four weeks total.

Three weeks for guided learning and one week for app development. 

→ [index](#index)

###Technical Assistance

You can contact other bootcamp participants or any available tutor if you need technical assistance. We will create one chat for boot camp members only, and another one for boot camp members and tutors when boot camp starts.

###Performance Measurement

1. Code review after each practice.

2. Checkpoint completion after Learning stage with your assigned tutor

→ [index](#index)


###Handling Advanced Developers

Developers that move faster than average can go ahead and complete as much exercises as wanted. 

→ [index](#index)

###Materials

1. Install [Java SDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

2. The IDE to use is [Eclipse for Java Developers](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).

3. Skype Account + headset (audio calls)

4. Create your own [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. Follow this [guideline](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) to setup your account. Also you can read further about Git in [Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) or [Learn Git Branching](http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/)

5. Fork this repo https://github.com/juanpablopizarro/java-bootcamp to use as a base to host the project code.

→ [index](#index)

 

###General Guidelines

The boot camp is organized in the following way:

1. The first three weeks will be used for intensive self learning. Each topic will have reading and practices parts. Tutors will be available to answer technical questions on a given chat room. 

2. The next week will be used to develop an application following a life process.

3. One boot camp chat will be created for feedback and technical assistance:

    Bootcamp HTML - ALL
Every person participating in the bootcamp is present here (students, tutors and PMs). Here is the place to ask for technical assistance!

4. [Team play](http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/ten-qualities-of-an-effective-team-player.html) is encouraged but the work will be evaluated per person.

5. The instructions will be vague as they generally are in real life projects. You must look for support and guidance from your PM, teammates and tutors.

6. All code and documentation must be in English.

7. Code must adhere to this [eclipse code formatter](https://github.com/juanpablopizarro/java-bootcamp/blob/master/formatter.xml).

→ [index](#index)

###Proposed Test Applications

The test application will consist in a functional shopping cart (just REST api). The minimum features to be completed are:

  - User registration and login.
  - Buy products.
  - Save Cart.
  - Find products by category and name.


###Learning Days###

Each day you will grab the fundamentals of the key building blocks for usual Java applications.

On each learning day you will have to:

1. ####Read:####
We will provide you with documentation related with current sprint content so you can have a background reference, guide and examples to complete the following practice.

2. ####Practice:####
You will implement the previously gathered knowledge in simple coding activities.
Most important task numbers are listed in the "*Key Points*" section for each day and they should get most of your attention; if you feel you don’t have enough time to complete all tasks, start with these ones when possible.

3. ####Commit:####
You will commit all your code on a daily basis, when you finish your practice.

1. Create a ShoppingCart where a user can buy different items and then decide how to pay them:
 
     * by Credit Card: where a Name and a Credit Number is required.

     * by Paypal: where an email and a password is needed.

     * Cash: no information is required.

2. Add the following discount depending on the payment type

     * 10% by Credit Card.

     * The cheapest item is for free when the user pay by Paypal.

     * 90% of the most expensive item is free if the user pays by Cash.

3. Create a counter to provide unique sequential numbers and use it to set an identification to each payment transaction.

4. Add functionality to display information about the list of items. The item should be displayed as:

     * Item Name ....... $ price

5. Add an offer that includes other individual items or other offers. Take into account that when an offer is displayed, it should say:

5. Maven: [best practices](http://books.sonatype.com/mvnref-book/reference/pom-relationships-sect-pom-best-practice.html)

#####Practice:#####

(It is assumed that Maven is already installed and working. I think it is not needed as an excercise to install maven locally).

1. Create a simple Maven project:
   - Here, the idea is to use the Maven Archetype plugin from the command line. Run the archetype:generate goal, selecting default archetype suggested by pressing "Enter". Create a simple a simple application that takes a name from console and print a greeting using the given name.
2. Building a Simple Project:
   - Create, compile, test, and install the Maven project created on the previous point. To prove that this program works, run it from the command line.
3. Customizing a Maven Project
   Expand the project created on point 2. The idea is to start playing with adding some dependencies, adding some source code, and customizing the project to suit specific needs. 
4. A Simple Web Application  
5. A Multi-module Project.
   Create a multi-module project that combines work done on previous points (2 and 5). The idea when completing this point is to be able to use Maven to develop complex, multi-module projects.

####Topic 3: Test Driven Development (2 day)####

#####Reading:#####
1. Watch the following videos:

   - [Test-driven development tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCif_-r8eK4)
   - [Let's Play TDD #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3G7gu1IHws)
   - [Let's Play TDD #2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-sBRRWBxSg)

2. [Test Driven Development](http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/test_driven_development.html)

3. Have fun with [Test Driven Development in Java using Eclipse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OluA0uJP9ts). 

#####Practice:#####

1. Convert an amount on a check to appropiate text. For example:
  * 2523.04 --> Two thousand five hundred twenty-three and 04/100 dollars

2. Develop a word-wrapping algorithm, which is given a string and a row-length, returns a list of word-wrapped rows. For example:
  * If the row-length is 60 and the input string is 30, the result is just the input string
  * If the row-length is 7 and the input string is "Hello Word!", the result should be: "Hello", "Word!"
  * If the row-length is 3 and the input string is "a b c d e f", the result should be "a b", "c d", "e f"
  * If the row-length is 5 and the input string is "Excelent", the result should be "Excel", "ent"

3. Use TDD to create the 'Recent file list' behaviour. Some examples of this behaviour is:
  * When the program is run for the first time, the list is empty.
  * When a file is opened, it is added to the recent file list.
  * If an opened file already exists in the recent file list, it is bumped to the top, not duplicated in the list.
  *If the recent file list gets full (typical number of items is 15), the oldest item is removed when a new item is added.

4. Create a Roman Number conversion (both ways, either int to Roman or Roman to int). All rules can be found on wikipedia: [Roman numerals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals).

5. American Soundex: This algorithm encodes words using a phonetic algorithm that promotes convergence of similar-sounding words. For more information about algorithm please read [American Soundex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex#American_Soundex). Create a function to return the proper soundex code.

6. Using TDD techniques such as mocking, faking and stubs, try to develop your own blog software featuring:
  * Post new entry
  * Delete existing entry
  * Update existing entry
  * Show 10 most recent entries
  * Tag an entry
  * Show all tags
  * Show blog entry with a certain tag
  * And so on...

2. [How to design a good API and why it matters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAb7hSCtvGw)

#####Practice:#####

1. Create a shopping cart API spec
2. Implement the previous shopping cart using TDD.
3. Document endpoints
4. Design a UserService for CRUD operations.
5. Implement and document previous UserService.
6. Add a uploadPhoto to the UserService
7. Add friends and likes (photos) to previous UserService.

Note: you can choose any endpoint documentation standard. As an example you can use the [twitter format](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/users/lookup)

Note 2: Do not implement JPA or ORM. Services should return in memory data only.

        Schedule:
          Monday 09:00 - 11:00: <course-name>
          Monday 15:00 - 17:30: <course-name>
          Friday 08:45 - 10:40: <course-name>

8. Identify and Optimize all queries
9. Create a table for students that have more than 1 partial note with a value less than 7. The table should contain the following information:
    * Student name
    * Course name
    * Average Note
10. Add a new column to the previous table (assigned teacher) and update it with the proper information.
11. Delete the oldest teacher (courses assigned to her should be empty).
